## Current Focus

•	Build and optimize real-time and batch data pipelines to feed ML models, handling structured/unstructured data streams from various sources.
•	Integrate machine learning models into Python-based server environments (e.g., FastAPI/Flask), ensuring low-latency, scalable model inference APIs.
•	Work with other data scientists to automate feature engineering, model training, and deployment processes for smooth handoff from development to production.
•	Containerize and deploy ML services using Docker and manage them on cloud platforms like AWS/GCP, with CI/CD pipelines for automation.
•	Implement logging and monitoring systems to track data flow, model performance, and system health; optimize infrastructure for efficiency and reliability.


## Volunteer Developers
