# For Research & Teaching

Our research and teaching tools use dynamic charts to present over 10 million data points from a fully transparent, open and freely available US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output ([USEEIO](https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models)) life cycle model created by the US EPA. Interactive [data](/data-pipeline/) visualizations provide insights across more than 20 environmental, social and economic indicators for 389 categories of goods and services in the United States.  Student and volunteer work focuses on both international and local impacts. We're working toward integrating [company](https://OpenCorporates.com) and [product](/products) zip code datasets.

[USEEIO embeddable charts](../charts/) can be a great starting point when developing sustainability initiatives.

<a href="../../localsite/info/">Our Industry Comparison Tools</a> answer questions like: What are the top industries in my community? How do these industries impact air, water, land, energy use, job creation, health and prosperity? Where can we focus innovation for the greatest&nbsp;returns?
