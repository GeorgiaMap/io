# Earthathon
### Online with DemocracyLab
#### Saturday, April , 202
**Noon to 8 PM EDT East Coast<br>9 AM to 5 PM PDT West Coast**

[Join our Google Meetup](https://meet.google.com/pcv-xrdh-bat) - We'll touchbase every two hours for 30+ minutes at Noon, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, and then wrap-up with other teams from 7pm to 8pm EDT.

We'll be creating visual food nutrition labels and environmental impact biodiversity storyboards with our new generative AI tools for images and video using python and Open WebUI.

<!--We'll use our Earthscape Chatbot UI fork to combine over 100 LLMs with Data Science visualizations. Real-time Natural language processing (NLP) processing of chats will pull locations, impact areas and UN goals for our chart output within cinematic page headers.-->

### Open WebUI and Earthscape

We're using [Open WebUI](../../projects/src/) and [Earthscape](../../earthscape/app/) to intereact with data from [Google Data Commons](../../data-commons/) in [Open Data Panels](/OpenFootprint).

[We're creating an API Feed Player](/feed/) for local [supply chains and job levels](/localsite/info/), [industry timelines](/data-pipeline/timelines/), [food labels](/data-commons/docs/food/) and [product profiles](../../io/template/).  

We have a new "[home](/home)" repo for highlighting team contributions. If you'd like more granular reporting, here's a [speadsheet for weekly logs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wvw_xsFWnYE9z8nDQqmu1m2LB5TJEfy5VLkaFuEaCfk/edit?usp=sharing).
