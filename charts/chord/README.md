# Separated Chord Chart

Our separated chord diagram resides in [Sector Supply Impacts](../../../profile/footprint/sector_supply_impacts.html) and is docmented at [profile/footprint/chord](../../../profile/footprint/chord)

The [Chord Diagrams](/profile/charts/d3/chord-diagram/) pull from state [inflow-outflow data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/useeio-json/tree/main/models/2020).

[Related work using Python](/machine-learning/python/cluster/) to pull from state matrix files and for viewing [commodity dollar values](/data-pipeline/research/economy/).
[Python for our Sankey chart](../sankey/) may also be a good starting point.
