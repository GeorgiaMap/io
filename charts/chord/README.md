# Chord Chart

TO DO: See to-do's on our [D Matrix Chord Chart page](/profile/charts/d3/chord-diagram/) that pulls from state [inflow-outflow data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/useeio-json/tree/main/models/2020). 

More examples of using javascript to pull input-output data on our [USEEIO.js Footprint page](https://model.earth/useeio.js/footprint/).

[Related work using Python](/machine-learning/python/cluster/) to pull from state matrix files and for viewing [commodity dollar values](/data-pipeline/research/economy/).
[Python for our Sankey chart](../sankey/) may also be a good starting point.
